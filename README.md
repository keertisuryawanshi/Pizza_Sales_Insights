# Pizza_Sales_Insights

Analyze pizza sales data to uncover key business insights! This project combines SQL and Tableau to explore sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity. SQL queries extract essential KPIs like total revenue, average order value, and sales volume. An interactive Tableau dashboard visualizes daily and monthly trends, sales distribution by category and size, and top and bottom-performing pizzas by revenue and orders. Perfect for data-driven decision-making and optimizing strategies.
